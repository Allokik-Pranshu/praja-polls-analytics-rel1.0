## Impact

### File Size Reduction
- Removed approximately 15+ unused files
- Eliminated duplicate data files (several MB of redundant data)
- Cleaned up unused CSS and JavaScript code

### Performance Improvements
- Reduced bundle size by removing unused functions
- Eliminated redundant data loading
- Removed unnecessary console.log statements for production

### Code Quality
- Removed unused variables that were causing linting warnings
- Cleaned up empty functions and redundant code
- Improved code maintainability by removing dead code

### Maintained Functionality
- All existing features continue to work as expected
- No breaking changes to user-facing functionality
- Preserved all necessary data and components

## Files Preserved
All essential files for the application functionality were preserved:
- All HTML pages and components
- All necessary JavaScript functionality
- All required CSS styles
- Essential data files (`js/up-data.js`, `js/ap-constituency-data.js`)
- Logo file (`images/ppalogo.svg`)

## Result
The codebase is now cleaner, more maintainable, and free of unused code while preserving all functionality.
